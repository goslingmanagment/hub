/**
 * Agent Read Plane — the closed capability matrix.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE CONST (and why it is closed): a key's grant is the only thing
 * standing between a machine principal and the agency's verbatim transcripts and
 * money. An unknown capability at issuance is REJECTED, never ignored — silently
 * dropping a typo would mint a key the owner believes is narrower than it is, and
 * silently accepting one would mint a grant nothing in the code can check.
 *
 * The list is normative in the contract appendix (§17.0.5). It is declared here
 * once so that key issuance, the per-operation requirement table, the `agent_keys`
 * CHECK constraint and the capabilities response all derive from the same literal.
 * Sibling of `agent-read-registry.ts`, which owns the claim/plane vocabulary only.
 *
 * Design reference: `investigations/agent-read-api-design-2026-07-31.md` §8.

/**
 * Exactly five. Adding a sixth is a contract change: it widens what a key can be
