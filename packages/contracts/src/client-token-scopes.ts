/**
 * Narrow device-token profiles (chat-extension hub-pr-plan H-3, §4.10.4).
 *
 * A client may ask, at password sign-in, for a device token bound to a
 * profile. The token stores the profile's NAME (`device_tokens.client_profile`,
 * immutable), never a list of operations: a route the profile gains later
 * reaches tokens already issued, with no re-issue.
 *
 * The API server refuses every route outside `operations` with a reason-less
 * 403, in both `AUTH_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT` modes; routes that take no principal
 * (`public`, `hmac`, `pending-device-token`) are not subject to it. The capture
 * lane accepts only `ingestKinds` from such a token, under the profile's own
 * producer.
 *
 * Never on a list: `/ofapi/*`, the event streams, the full persona texts and
 * their writes, the raw AI gateway, the Fansly outreach route, the top-spenders
 * read, and any cookie-session route.
 *
 * The boundary is honest about what it is: it keeps a leaked or misbehaving
 * extension inside its own surface. The person behind it can still sign in
 * with the same password and take a full token.
