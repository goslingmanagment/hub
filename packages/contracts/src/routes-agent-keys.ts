/**
 * Agent Read Plane — owner administration of the KEYS themselves.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN `routes-agent.ts`: that module is the read plane, and its
 * pins say so — eleven operations, exactly one of them owner-session, an envelope
 * on every 200. Issuing a key is none of those things: it is the owner minting a
 * machine principal, it has no `capture`/`conclusion` to carry, and folding it in
 * would have meant loosening the very pins that make the read plane checkable.
 *
 * WHY IT IS STILL UNDER `/api/v1/agent/`: the plane's `Cache-Control: no-store`
 * hook keys on that prefix, and a response that carries a freshly minted bearer
 * token is the LAST one that may sit in an intermediary. The routes are therefore
 * also registered by the agent-read registrar, after the hook exists.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERY SCHEMA HERE: **the raw token is returned once
 * and the digest is never returned at all.** `agentKeyItemSchema` is what a
 * listing may say about a key; there is no code path that widens it.
 *
 * Two validations are DELIBERATELY not restated here:
 *  - the closed capability matrix is derived from `AGENT_CAPABILITIES`, so an
 *    unknown capability is a 400 from the schema and the table CHECK is the
 *    backstop, not a second copy of the rule;
 *  - the 365-day lifetime ceiling is NOT a `.max()` on `expiresInDays`. It lives
 *    in `insertAgentKey` and in the table CHECK; an over-long request travels all
 *    the way there and comes back as that ONE enforcement point's 400. A ceiling
 *    written twice is a ceiling that drifts.
