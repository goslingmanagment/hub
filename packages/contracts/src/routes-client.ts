/**
 * Routes of the chat extension (`chat-extension`), the hub's third client.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE MODULE: every route the new client gets lands here (group
 * `clientRouteSchemas`), so its PRs touch one new file instead of `routes.ts`,
 * which the Sync Engine changes almost daily. `routes.ts` spreads the group into
 * `routeSchemas`, behind its own name in `RouteSchemas` (TS7056, see there).
 *
 * Imports come only from `zod`, `./primitives.ts` and the vendored part of
 * `@agency_hub_core/shared`. Never from `./routes.ts`: it imports this module,
 * so the reverse import is a cycle.
 *
 * Shape law for every client route (chat-extension docs/hub-pr-plan.md §4.0):
 * - bodies and query strings are `.strict()`;
 * - response objects are NOT strict: an SDK frozen in a shipped client strips a
 *   key it does not know instead of failing the whole response, so a new field
 *   is always optional and never breaks an installed client;
 * - a vocabulary that grows (flags, capabilities, reasons, platforms, roles) is
 *   an open string on the wire. `z.enum`, `z.record(z.enum…)` and
 *   `z.array(z.enum…)` refuse an unknown member, so one new platform or flag
 *   would break the parse of the whole bootstrap in every installed client. The
 *   known members are the exported constants below; a client narrows to them
 *   itself and reads an unknown member as "off" / "unknown".

//
// THE CLIENT'S SHAPE. The chat extension froze the query and the answer in its
// contracts (`AudienceNewQuerySchema`, `AudienceNewPageSchema`,

// schema lets out and answers only what it reads: `fanRef` is the one numeric
// id shape there, so an event whose fan id is not one is never a row.
//
// ONE WALK, ONE WINDOW. A request without a cursor starts a walk and fixes its
// window: `window.to` and `window.snapshotAt` are the hub's clock at that
// moment, `window.from` is `hours` before, and every later page repeats them. A
// subscription the hub learns of during the walk is not in it; the next walk
// from the first page has it. The cursor is opaque and signed, valid for the
// same page and person, for an hour: anything else is 400 `bad_request` with
// the reason `cursor_invalid`, and a cursor presented with another
// `windowHours` is 400 with `cursor_window_mismatch`. Either way the client
// reads the first page again.
//
// The rows of a walk are fixed; what is said ABOUT each fan (`status`,
// `thread`, `claim`) and the page-level `coverage` and `welcomeTemplate` are
// read when the page is asked for.

// ── client_health v1 (H-11a) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The chat extension's health report: its version, the host build fingerprint,
// the host-contract verdict, what is switched off, counters by code, perf
// histograms and an estimate of its own storage. No text from a chat and no fan,
// chat, message or operation id.
//
// THE CLIENT'S SHAPE. The chat extension froze this report in its contracts
// v1.0.0 (`ClientHealthV1Schema` in its packages/contracts/src/telemetry.ts; its
// `kind` rides the ingest envelope, the rest is this body). The metric names and
// bounds, the field names and every limit below are the client's, and every
// report the client's schema accepts parses here: a report the hub refused would
// be lost with its P1 counters. The hub adds only checks such a report always
// meets: counts = bounds + 1 and count = Σcounts (the client's own), strictly
// increasing bounds (the client pins every histogram to this registry), an empty
// histogram with sum 0 and max 0, one histogram per metric.
//
// Codes, not free text: host anchors, switched-off features, counter keys, the
// host kind and metric names match CLIENT_HEALTH_CODE_PATTERN, ASCII without
// spaces, so a sentence, a fan's name with a space or a URL does not fit in one.
// Two fields are the client's bounded strings, not codes: the client version
// (its manifest version) and the host build (the hashed name of the host's entry
// module). And a code may name an inherited object property (`constructor`); a
// record drops an own `__proto__` key without a word, as on the client. The
// intake (H-11b) keys its user-free hourly rollups, kept forever, on these
// strings (client version, host kind and build, metric, anchor, counter code),
// so it files a version or build that is not a code under one placeholder, and
// merges codes into a Map, never into a plain object.
//
// No route carries it and nothing on the hub reads it yet, so the contract hash
// does not move: this is the shape the client and the hub agree on. The client
// sends a report as one `ingestObservations` event of kind
// CLIENT_HEALTH_INGEST_KIND, in a batch of its own, and ONLY once the bootstrap
// lists `client-health-perf-v1`; until then it keeps its reports to itself. A
// hub older than the intake (H-11b) journals an unknown kind in `observations`
// (`desktop.unknown:<kind>`) with the user, forever and on into the lake, which
// is exactly what this report must never become. The intake (H-11b) never
// journals the kind, from any token: behind the capability (the owner's
// `chatExtensionHealthIngestEnabled`) it checks a report against this schema
// and the bounds registry and folds it into hourly rollups keyed without the
// user; without it, it accepts the report and keeps nothing.
//
// A client→hub shape, so strict (§4.0): an unknown key is a malformed report,
// and a new field is a new report version. Growing names (metric, host kind)
// stay open, as codes: one the hub does not know it drops, and the rest of the
// report still counts. The checks below are cheap and local (no clock, no
// registry). The intake checks a known metric's bounds against the registry,
// drops a histogram whose max or sum its buckets cannot hold (the runtime's
// `clientHealthHistogramFits`), and files a report under the hour it received
// it, not the client's window.
