/**
 * Agent Read Plane — the wire contracts of operations #1..#10.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE MODULE: `routes.ts` is 178 operations of dashboard/client
 * surface; the plane is one coherent contract with its own envelope law, its own
 * principal and its own vocabulary, and mixing it in would bury both. `routes.ts`
 * spreads `agentRouteSchemas` into `routeSchemas`, so registration, the auth
 * declaration test and the OpenAPI generator see one flat registry as before.
 *
 * THE LAW THIS FILE ENCODES (design spec §5, appendix §17):
 *
 * Every 200 carries three INDEPENDENT axes plus a list of limitations:
 *   - `delivery` — a property of the RESPONSE (how much came back, what capped it);
 *   - `capture`  — a property of the WORLD, computed from {key scope, source,
 *                  requested window} and NOTHING else (invariant 7: the same
 *                  request with and without result filters must serialize a
 *                  byte-identical `capture`);
 *   - `fieldStates`/`provenance` — per record, and `capture.scopeFieldStates`
 *                  BEFORE any row is fetched, so an empty result never reads as
 *                  a statement about a field;
 *   - `conclusion.blockers` — every reason this answer is narrower than the
 *                  question. An empty collection ALWAYS arrives with a populated
 *                  `capture` and a non-empty `blockers`; a bare `[]` is the bug
 *                  this whole envelope exists to make impossible.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT (owner ruling 2026-08-01): there is no
 * `absenceProvable` field, no cryptographic-proof plane basis, no capture ceiling
 * and no gap-detection mode. The certification machinery was unreachable on every
 * real route — nothing served a verified gap sweep, and the proof reads were the
 * slowest queries in the slice — so it was removed rather than left as a field
 * that is structurally always `false`. What survives is the part that answers the
 * original question: `captureFloor` says when this store's record of a thread
 * BEGINS, and `gaps[before_capture_floor]` says the asked-for window is earlier
 * than that. "We hold nothing before DATE" is a fact about this system; "nothing
 * happened before DATE" was never sayable and is no longer implied.
 *
 * Vocabulary is DERIVED, never restated: plane names, claim fields, capabilities
 * and dataset names come from `agent-read-registry.ts`,
 * `agent-read-capabilities.ts` and `agent-read-datasets.ts`. A drift becomes a
 * compile error instead of a lie in a response body.
 *
 * ZOD v4 TRAP (documented in routes.ts:387-391, restated by appendix §17.0.3):
 * `.merge()/.pick()/.omit()/.partial()` SILENTLY DROP `superRefine`. So: base
 * field schemas carry no refinements, cross-field rules are plain helpers
 * returning issues, and each composite applies them in ONE terminal
 * `.superRefine()` after all `{...X.shape}` spreads. A schema that already has a
 * `.superRefine()` is never composed further.
