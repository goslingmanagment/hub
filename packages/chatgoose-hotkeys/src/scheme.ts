/** The one ChatGoose hotkey table, shared by the Fansly extension and the
 * OnlyFans desktop app (vendored into both by scripts/vendor-hotkeys.mjs).
 *
 * Two levels, identical in both clients:
 * - "text": everything that writes into the reply field (Reply, Fix, Hi,
 *   Ping) plus Cancel — Cmd+key on macOS, Ctrl+key on Windows.
 * - "panel": analysis, panels and toggles — Cmd+Shift+key on macOS,
 *   Ctrl+Alt+key on Windows (Ctrl+Shift and Alt+Shift switch the input
 *   language on the team's Windows machines, so neither can carry hotkeys).
 *
 * Keys are matched by KeyboardEvent.code (the physical key), so the scheme
 * works on the Russian layout without switching it. The letter choices and
 * the platform constraints behind them live in README.md. */
